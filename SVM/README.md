===================================

Classify digits with SVM Model

## Pre-requisite
* Linux OS
* Python 3.3+
* Jupyter Notebook
* GitHub

## Steps for installation / Setup
* Open Terminal
* Run the command - git clone 
* Browse into directory (hint: command - cd assignments)
* Install any dependent libs if needed
* On successful installations of libs, run "jupyter notebook"

## Steps to execute program
* On jupyter notebook, navigate to the directory where assignments git repo was cloned in previous step
* Navigate to SVM/
* Click on "HW6.ipynb"
* Click on "Run" icon from the menu

## Parameters selected for linear, radial, polynomial kernels
* Linear:
  - Hyper parameter: C
  - Kernel: linear
* Radial:
  - Hyper parameter: gamma
  - Kernel: rbf
* Polynomial:
  - Hyper parameter: degree
  - Kernel: poly

## Accuracy comparison between linear, radial, polynomial kernels
* Linear: 0.966
* Radial: 0.974
* Polynomial: 0.961
